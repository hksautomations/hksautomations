# Hi, I’m Harvish 👋

I design and build **production-grade AI automation systems** that replace
manual workflows while preserving control, safety, and explainability.

---

## What I Work On

- AI-powered workflow automation (n8n + LLMs)
- Lead generation & outreach systems
- RAG-based knowledge assistants
- Research & content automation pipelines

I specialize in **hybrid systems** where AI reasoning is combined with
deterministic control logic.

---

## How I Approach AI Automation

- AI suggests — systems decide
- Confidence is measured, not assumed
- Human override is always available
- Safety mechanisms are built-in

Automation should reduce risk, not create new ones.

## Featured Work

➡️ **HKS Automation Systems**  
A complete repository documenting architectures, patterns, samples, and
client-facing AI automation practices.

(See pinned repository below 👇)

---

## Tools & Stack

- n8n (workflow orchestration)
- Large Language Models (OpenAI, Groq)
- JavaScript for control logic
- APIs, CRMs, and document systems

## Let’s Connect

If you’re exploring AI automation for real-world workflows,
I’m happy to discuss system design and feasibility.
