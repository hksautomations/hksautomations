# Hi, I’m Harvish 👋

I design and build **production-grade AI automation systems** that replace manual workflows while preserving **control, safety, and explainability**.

My work focuses on real-world automation — not demos, agents, or experiments.

---

## What I Work On

- AI-powered workflow automation (n8n + LLMs)
- Lead generation & outreach systems
- RAG-based knowledge assistants
- Research and content automation pipelines

I specialize in **hybrid systems** where AI reasoning is combined with deterministic control logic.

---

## How I Approach AI Automation

- AI suggests — **systems decide**
- Confidence is measured, not assumed
- Human override is always available
- Safety mechanisms are built in by design

Automation should reduce risk, not create new ones.

## Tools & Stack

- n8n (workflow orchestration)
- Large Language Models (OpenAI, Groq)
- JavaScript for control logic
- APIs, CRMs, and document systems
